7, 9, 6, 4, 0, 1, 2, 5,3, 8
merge sort:
breaking into 1 element sets
7:9:6:4:0:1:2:5:3:8
merge sets with adjacent sets
7,9:4,6:0,1:2,5:3,8
continue until 1 set left
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
quick sort:
pick pivot point:
pick 1
move values into correct side of pivot =>
0   1   2..9
repeat pivoting in partitions until each partition set <=2
merge these partitions until 1 partition left
in merging left and right partitions are in order.
