closed hashing:


insert(k,v):
    h = hash(k)
    insert(k,v) into next available slot in bucket h
    if bucket h overflows upscale hashing.
find(k):
    h = hash(k)
    find bucket h
    compare k to bucket h's k values or end the values
delete(k):
    h =hash(k)
    find bucket h
    find matching k in bucket
    delete k row
    move last row from bucket h into deleted slot
